# README for the BE Project

This project is a backend application designed to manage timetables and user authentication. It is structured to provide a clear separation of concerns, with distinct directories for configuration, controllers, models, routes, services, middleware, utilities, tests, and documentation.

## Project Structure

- **config/**: Contains configuration files for database connections, constants, and file uploads.
- **controllers/**: Handles the logic for API endpoints related to timetables and authentication.
- **models/**: Defines the data schemas for timetables, users, and classes.
- **routes/**: Defines the API endpoints for timetable and authentication operations.
- **services/**: Contains business logic related to timetables and authentication.
- **middleware/**: Implements authentication checks and centralized error handling.
- **utils/**: Provides utility functions for logging, validation, and standardized API responses.
- **tests/**: Contains unit and integration tests for the application.
- **docs/**: Holds API documentation, potentially using Swagger or OpenAPI Specification.
